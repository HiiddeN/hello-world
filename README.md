Hello World Repo
Halloween is my favorite holiday.
The spirit of Halloween endures all throughout October and brings with it many fun activities.
Halloween differs from Christmas in that the weather is more suitable for actively participating in the activities.
Christmas, like Halloweem, also has a lasting spirit that begins in December.
Halloween is my preferred holiday because spooky things are fun.
